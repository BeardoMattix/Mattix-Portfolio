## Motivation

Because this portfolio was built using React, I wanted to spend the time to learn as much as possible; which is why I decided to start from scratch and build and entirely new verision of my portfolio.

#### Technologies

- React
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- FormSubmit

## Functionality

## Challenges

The main challenge I faced with this project was using React and learning how to break things into different components. Once I had the Navbar working the right way, it became easier and easier to create the individual components and have them render properly on the page.

## Usage

- Employers can quickly see my projects and resume.
- Employers can get a sense of my visual design skills.
- Employers can use the "Contact Me" section to see my social media accounts, ask questions, and email me.

## Future Development

- Include animations to make the projects section look better.
