# Welcome to my Portfolio!

## Learn all about me and my journey as a developer.

#### This is a React web application built using HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, and FormSubmit as the email client. Employers can use this page to learn about me, the projects I have worked on, view my various social media accounts, and download my current resume.

## Motivation

Because this portfolio was built using React, I wanted to spend the time to learn as much as possible; which is why I decided to start from scratch and build and entirely new verision of my portfolio.

#### Technologies

- React
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- FormSubmit

## Functionality

![Portfolio-demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82903201/127873720-85edb49e-e372-4519-ac90-f53628414727.gif)

#### The demo shows the main functions of my Portfolio:

- Users can navigate the site using the Explore dropdown menu.
- Projects are displayed as animated gifs, and include links to the deployed sites and the GitHub repositories.
- When a user click on the resume, a copy is downloaded onto their device.
- GitHub and LinkedIn profiles are updated.
- The Contact Me section includes links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter, as well as my email address and a form for asking questions.

## Challenges

The main challenge I faced with this project was deigning a mobile-first site. I wanted my portfilio to look and function well on mobile devices, and spent a lot of time making sure the site functioned on smaller screens.

## Usage

- Employers can quickly see my projects and resume.
- Employers can get a sense of my visual design skills.
- Employers can use the "Contact Me" section to see my social media accounts, ask questions, and email me.

## Future Development

- Make the site run accross multiple pages to make the information stand out better.
- Include a list of technologies I am familiar with.
- Include animations to make the projects section look better.
